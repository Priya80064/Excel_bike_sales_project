# Excel_bike_sales_project


## Overview

This repository contains an interactive **Bike Sales Dashboard** created using Microsoft Excel. The project is part of a guided learning exercise and showcases data visualization techniques to analyze and present sales trends and customer demographics effectively.

## Features

The dashboard provides insights into:
- **Average Income Per Purchase**: Income distribution by gender and purchase status.
- **Customer Age Brackets**: Analysis of bike purchase behavior across different age groups.
- **Customer Commute Distance**: Commute distance trends among customers who purchased bikes versus those who did not.

## Filters and Interactivity

The dashboard includes slicers for dynamic filtering based on:
- **Marital Status** (Married, Single)
- **Region** (Europe, North America, Pacific)
- **Education Level** (Bachelor's, Graduate, High School, etc.)

Users can interact with the dashboard by selecting these filters to customize the visualizations.

## How to Use

1. Download the Excel file from the repository.
2. Open it in Microsoft Excel (2013 or later recommended).
3. Use the slicers on the left side of the dashboard to filter data dynamically.
4. Analyze the visualized data and gain insights into the bike sales trends.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates the use of:
- Excel's data visualization tools (charts, slicers, and conditional formatting).
- Interactive dashboards to make data analysis more user-friendly and insightful.

## Sample Insights

1. **Gender and Income**: Males tend to have higher average income per purchase than females.
2. **Age Trends**: Middle-aged individuals (31â€“54) are the most frequent bike buyers.
3. **Commute Preferences**: Customers with shorter commute distances are more likely to purchase bikes.

## Future Improvements

- Add more data dimensions, such as product types or promotional impacts.
- Incorporate advanced visualizations using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
- Automate data updates using Excel's Power Query or VBA.
